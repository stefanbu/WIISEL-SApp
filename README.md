# WIISEL-SApp
Android app, that receives and manages data from wireless insoles via BLE. Includes fall detection.

WIISEL = Wireless Insole for Independent & Safe Elderly Living

Falls are a major health problem for older adults, through both immediate effects: fractures and head injuries and longer term problems: disability, fear of falling and loss of independence.

WIISEL has developed a flexible research tool to collect and analyze gait data from real users and correlate parameters related with the risk of falls from the elderly population. Coordinated by CETEMMSA, it was co-funded by the European Commission (FP7-ICT).

The utility and impact of using the WIISEL system on the research and clinical community is the following:

Allowing for remote and quantitative assessment of a user’s fall risk
Measuring activity and mobility in daily living conditions
As a clinical assessment tool, allowing its useas part of any research and assessment of gait parameters.
Enabling the early identification of functional mobility decline in performance (i.e. assessment of motor fluctuations and disease progression)
Enabling fall detection in the home setting

The WIISEL tool consists of a combination of a flexible software platform together with wearable insole device collecting data related with gait. Risk of falls is assessed based on multiple gait parameters and gait pattern recognition. WIISEL allows quantifying activity, assessing the quality of gait under real life conditions and enables researchers to evaluate and monitor fall risk in elderly patients, in the home and community environment, mostly reflecting everyday life behavior.

Thanks to a wireless system and several sensors embedded into the insole, the data captured by the movement of the foot are sent first to a mobile device and later to a server, so that the evolution of a patient can be monitored remotely in terms of gait, fall risk, activity and mobility.

Partners envolved in the development:
 

- Fundació Privada CETEMMSA (CETEMMSA), Spain
- Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), Spain
- Istituto Nazionale di Riposo e Cura per Anziani INRCA (INRCA), Italy
- The Foundation for Medical Research Infrastructural Development and Health Services next to the Medical Center TEL AVIV (TASMC), Israel
- Spring Techno GMBH & CO. KG (SPRING TECHNO), Germany
- Tejidos Indesmallables GEISA, S.L. (GEISA), Spain
- National University of Ireland, GALWAY (NUI Galway), Ireland
- ACREO AB, Sweden


The project was finished in April 2015.
